# cammonDB
The simplest database built from scratch.

Will be based on the SQLite database, as there is plenty of material and resources online to aid us. Though we will try to use these as little as possible.

We will first look to implement a **B+ Tree** Data structure, followed by a Pager component. Both of these will be used to handle the data lookup.
